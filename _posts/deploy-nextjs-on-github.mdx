Deploying your Next.js application on GitHub Pages is a great way to make your project accessible to the world. GitHub Pages provides a simple and free hosting solution for static websites. In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to deploy your Next.js application on GitHub Pages.

## Step 1: Configure Your Next.js Project

First, configure your Next.js project for static export. Update your next.config.js file:

```js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  output: "export",
  basePath: "/your-repo-name",
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

## Step 2: Install GitHub Pages Deployment Package

Install the gh-pages package:

```bash
yarn add -D gh-pages
```

## Step 3: Update package.json

Modify your package.json to include the following:

```json
{
  "homepage": "https://username.github.io/repository",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "export": "next export",
    "predeploy": "npm run build && touch out/.nojekyll",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d out --dotfiles"
  }
}
```

> Replace username and repository with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

## Step 4: Create GitHub Repository

Create a new repository on GitHub for your project if you haven't already.

## Step 5: Initialize Git and Push to GitHub

If you haven't initialized Git in your project, do so and push to GitHub:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 6: Deploy Your Application

Run the deployment command:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

This command will build your project, create a .nojekyll file to bypass Jekyll processing, and push the contents of the out directory to the gh-pages branch of your repository.

## Step 7: Configure GitHub Pages Settings

Go to your repository on GitHub
Navigate to Settings > Pages
Under "Source", select the gh-pages branch
Save the changes

## Step 8: Set Up GitHub Actions (Optional)

For automated deployments, go to settings -> pages -> then on build and deployment choose Github Actions.
It should automatically recognise the codebase and it will populate a `.github/workflows/nextjs.yml` into your project and once you merge that in github it should start a build.

This workflow will automatically build and deploy your site when you push to the main branch

## Step 9: Verify Your Deployment

After the deployment is complete, your site should be accessible at https://username.github.io/repository/.
Remember to commit and push your changes to the main branch after making these configurations. GitHub will automatically trigger the deployment process based on your setup24.
By following these steps, you should be able to successfully deploy your Next.js application on GitHub Pages. Make sure to test your deployment and verify that all your routes and assets are working correctly
